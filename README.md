# burgerSequelize

Time to eat some burgers!

Visit the site https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/lit-cove-21690 to eat some burgers. You can input new orders, and then promptly devour them. 

This is an exercise using Sequelize with JawsDB to create a data persistant app. Functionality may be slightly limited (what else would you want to do but eat burgers?), but database interaction is seamless.
